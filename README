As a pragmatric programmer, this library is written to solve _my_ problems and not yours.

Dealing with 2D views in games seems first to be a trivial task,
but certain things are hard to keep remembering.

For example, how to you calculate a view that contain the entire map by fixed ratio?
How do you create a general function for splitting a screen view into more parts?

See 'mapview.h' for complete documentation.

The file 'mapview-test.c' does unit tests.
